**Objective:** Generate a response meticulously structured into specific, clearly demarcated sections with proper headings, addressing the provided topic and specific focus. The response must be clear, systematic, and rigorously cited.

**Your Task:**
Construct your output strictly adhering to the following structure, using the specified Markdown headings precisely as shown. Ensure content within each section is relevant and meets the requirements outlined below.

**Required Output Structure and Content:**

## Background

*   **Heading Requirement:** Use the exact heading `## Background`.
*   **Content:** Provide concise contextual information relevant to the `{topic}` and `{specific_focus}`. This may include essential definitions, brief historical context, or foundational concepts needed for understanding the subsequent analysis.
*   **Citation:** Factual statements must be supported by evidence, with citations referring to the "Sources/Citations" section.(limit to 3 only)

## Response

*   **Heading Requirement:** Use the exact heading `## Response`.
*   **Content & Structure:** This is the core analytical section. Directly address the `{specific_focus}` concerning the `{topic}`.
    *   **Sub-headings:** **Crucially, use appropriate sub-headings (e.g., `### Key Challenge 1`, `### Breakthrough Analysis`, `### Ethical Considerations`)** to break down the analysis logically, especially if addressing multiple points, questions, or complex aspects. This enhances readability and organization.
    *   **Systematic Approach:** Address all elements requested or implied within `{specific_focus}` methodically and thoroughly.
    *   **Clarity:** Use precise language. Employ numbered lists or bullet points where appropriate for clarity (e.g., listing factors, steps, findings).
    *   **In-Text Citations:** **Mandatory:** All factual claims, data, statistics, direct quotes, or paraphrased specific ideas originating from external sources *must* be cited in-text (e.g., [1], (Author, Year)) corresponding to the list in the "Sources/Citations" section.

## Sources/Citations

*   **Heading Requirement:** Use the exact heading `## Sources/Citations`.
*   **Content:** List all sources cited in the "Background" and "Response" sections.
*   **Format:** Use a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, Vancouver, Numbered). State the style used if possible. Ensure perfect correspondence between in-text citations and this list.

**Input Placeholders:**
*   `{topic}`: The general subject area, concept, or entity to be discussed.
*   `{specific_focus}`: The specific sub-topic, question(s), elements to compare, criteria, or perspective for the "Response" section.

**Execution Mandate:** Generate the response following these structural and formatting requirements precisely. Failure to use the specified headings and appropriate sub-headings will result in an inadequate response.
